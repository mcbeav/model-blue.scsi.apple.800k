# BlueSCSI Case Model

BlueSCSI case modelled after an Apple 800k external floppy drive.

*The bottom plate is poorly designed. The design was meant to include the SCSI cable connector inside of the case, so that the connector would not be visible from outside of the case. The model should be simple enough to modify.*

*The apple cutout is the correct size to fit an apple from a powerbook / powerbook duo.*

*The magnets used in this project are 5mm in diameter and 2mm tall.*
